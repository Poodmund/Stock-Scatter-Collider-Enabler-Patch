# Stock Scatter Collider Enabler Patch v1.0.1

This version of the Stock Scatter Collider Enabler Patch has been built to work for KSP version 1.8.# - 1.11.# as of the date 12th Feb 2021.

### 1 - About

The recent celestial body revamps implemented by SQUAD into KSP are of a high enough quality that many players are no longer using 3rd party mods that revamp the surface terrain. Due to this change in 3rd party mod usage, it has become apparent that there was no solution to enable the stock ground scatter collider meshes through the use of Kopernicus available to the community. This mod aims to provide this solution by providing a small patch to enable these ground scatter collider meshes for the stock ground scatter instances on the stock bodies for Kerbal Space Program.

### 2 - How to Install

Extract the GameData folder found in the downloadable .zip directly into your Kerbal Space Program install directory. If located correctly, the SSCEP directory should be found at:

* \Kerbal Space Program\GameData\SSCEP

### 3 - Dependencies

The following KSP mod must be installed prior to using the Stock Scatter Collider Enabler Patch mod (ensure that you install the correct version of the dependency for your version of KSP):

* Kopernicus (depending on KSP version) - https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases
* Module Manager - https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-*
